# Better call Saul #
A prequel to Breaking Bad, this series follows the transformation of Jimmy McGill, a struggling attorney, into the ethically dubious lawyer Saul Goodman. The show dives into Jimmy’s relationships, ambitions, and the choices that ultimately lead him into the criminal underworld. It explores his ties to both the legal world and Albuquerque’s crime scene.
Rich character development, legal and ethical dilemmas, dark humor, and links to Breaking Bad.
